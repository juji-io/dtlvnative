# dtlvnative

Provides pre-built native dependencies for
[Datalevin](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin) database. This is done by
packaging the compiled native libraries and JavaCPP JNI library files in the
platform specific JAR files.

In addition to JavaCPP's JNI library, these native libraries are included:

* `lmdb` LMDB key value library.
* `dtlv` wraps LMDB and implements Datalevin comparator, iterators, counters and
  samplers.
* `usearch` Vector indexing and similartiy search library.

The following platforms are currently supported:

* macosx-arm64
* macosx-x86_64
* linux-arm64
* linux-x86_64
* windows-x86_64

The name of the released JAR is `org.clojars.huahaiy/dtlvnative-PLATFORM`, where
`PLATFORM` is one of the above.

## Additional dependencies

Right now, the included shared libraries depend on some system libraries.

* `libc`
* `libomp` or `libgomp`
* `libmvec`

On systems that these are not available by default, you will have to install
them yourself. For example, on Ubuntu/Debian, `apt install libgomp1`, or `apt
install gcc-12 g++-12`; on MacOS, `brew install libomp libllvm`

Building these into our jars statically is a future work. PR is always welcome.
